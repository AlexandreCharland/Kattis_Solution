l1 := 1 2 3 4 5 3 6
l2 := 2 1 3 6 5 4 3
Consider the partial sums s1(a) the partial sum of l1 up to the a element
s1(0) = 1
s1(1) = 3
s1(2) = 6
...
Same for s2(a)
s2(0) = 2
s2(1) = 3
s2(2) = 6
...
We arrive to this Principe
A permutation occur after a elements => s1(a)==s2(a)
The proof is simple, the addiction is a commutative operation.
There is a problem with this approche, the false positiv
Consider
l1 = 1 4 2 3
l2 = 2 3 1 4
s1(1) = 5 = s2(1)
To help with this problem we will also keep track of the partial product of list.
Although I haven't prove it, I am fairly sure that
A permutation occur after a elements <=> s1(a)==s2(a) and p1(a)==p2(a)
Now since the number can be quite big, I have decided to modulo the product and the sum by a prime number. This can add false positif, but it is unlikely to occur with a big enough prime.
