Initialy this repo contain problem of difficulty 3.0 and up. I started to have to many of them. I will keep the problem for witch I have created a pdf for explication but hid the rest. I hope to have the same problem for problem 4.0 and up in the futur.\

I have made them public to help with the debugging.\
I know from personal experience how frustrating it can be to have one test case wrong.\
Pls only use my solutions to find that one test case that doesn't work.
