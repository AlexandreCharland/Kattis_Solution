This will contain some of my solutions to kattis problem of difficulty 3.0 and above.\
I won't upload the solution of problems difficulty 3.0 to 3.9 since I am starting to have a lot of them.\
Pls do not copy my solutions.\
I have made them publish to help with the debugging.\
I know from personal experience how frustrating it can be to have one test case wrong.\
Pls only use my solutions to find that one test case that doesn't work.
