The idea is to parcour the ring from all four directions.
For exemple
TT.T
TTTT
.T.T
The first parcour (->) will be
1 2 0 1
1 2 3 4
0 1 0 1
The number represent the "streak" from the (->) direction.
The second parcour keep the mimimum between the current value and the streak from the (<-) direction.
1 1 0 1
1 2 2 1
0 1 0 1
The third parcour is the same, min between the current value and the streak (V).
1 1 0 1
1 2 1 1
0 1 0 1
Same idea for the fourth parcour, you also need to keep in mind the best value found for the correct spacing.
